Hi, I am BLOODMOON !!!

Just run the Games_menu.rb file to run the program, the other files are sub-files only
You must go to the link to download the 'Media' folder!

To have a look on my program, please see the Custom Code Demonstration Video in:
    https://liveswinburneeduau-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/104053642_student_swin_edu_au/ES1PEgv-2V5DjIf498phmIYBGbXGdkOnw3qsv1ihqkU34w?e=y78l9t
or

P/s: In this video I will only try to give a clear and overall instruction of how to use the program
and play the four games, for more information, especially the code explanation, please see my 
attached report pdf file!!

Thank you very much!!
